# AndroidColorGame
An android Game for my little daughter, change color by tap screen or shaking the phone, later will add voice control;

It is very simple now, switch colors in Red/Blue/Green/Whhite; 

just now it listens two kind of events, click events from touch and gravity events from accelerator sensor.

later i'd like to add voice control to change the color;
